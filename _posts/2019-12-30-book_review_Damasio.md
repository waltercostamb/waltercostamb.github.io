Damásio</a><br/>
My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2740658710">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I absolutely loved this book! It is obvious from the read that Professor Damásio is an expert in neuroscience and has a great grasp in all adjoining fields, including bioinformatics. It is accessible to experts and non-experts alike, even considering the many mentions of specific brain components and evolutionary concepts. <br /><br />This book joins complex ideas from many different fields beautifully, including neurology, evolution, psychology and bioinformatics. It builds on the idea of connection between brain and body with sound arguments using the best of scientific research. Going from the simplest of bacterial communications and workouts to maintain homeostasis to how the human body and brain interact to also maintain homeostasis, the author brings new light into mental maps, feelings and the unity of body and brain.<br /><br />Fundamental read for researchers of brain evolution, psychiatrists, generalists and psychologists.
