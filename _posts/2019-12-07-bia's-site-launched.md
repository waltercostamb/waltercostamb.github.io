title: "Becoming a Bioinformatician"

Hi, welcome to my blog! I am a swiss-brazilian scientist who studied biology in the bachelors and moved on to bioinformatics during the Masters and PhD. I work nowadays with theoretical biology and data analysis. 

I wanted to be a scientist ever since I was a child.
I love biology and understanding how living systems work. As an undergrad I was very happy with my biology studies, but did not like computers at all. 

This changed drastically when I discovered Linux and script programming. I really enjoyed 
programming for the first time, creating my own tools and analysing data. I could play with files, try
different things and see the results in a really fast pace. It was not easy to learn to program and understand about
computer science, but I felt this was the right area for me, and I really found myself in this field.  

I see bioinformatics 
as a modern and robust approach to study biology. I am very happy with how my career turned out so far, and I am eternally 
greatful to all of the wonderful people who helped me navigate through it, most notably my dear Masters and PhD advisors: Peter Stadler, Katja Nowick, Marcelo Brigido, Andrea Maranhao and Taina Raiol.
