This is my first post to this Bioinformatics blog. I intend with it to give a bit more popular flavor to the strict scientific 
speech all academics like me are so used to. As a first informal introduction, I am a swiss-brazilian scientist who studied 
biology in the bachelor and moved on to a much more theoretical field during my grad studies, namely bioinformatics and 
computer science. I work nowadays with theoretical biology and computational analysis of biological data. 

I wanted to be a scientist ever since I was a child and I knew biology was my calling right at the first year of highschool.
I love biology and understanding how living systems work. As an undergrad I used a lot of Windows systems and Microsoft Office, 
and to be honest, these tools had led to a lot of frustration. I lost tons of information because of system failures, got 
super confused with all the disorganization that comes naturally with an un-structured system, which led to my overall hatred
of computers. All this mess got in the way, and I felt held back. 

This scenario changed drastically when I discovered the wonderful world of Linux and script programming. I really enjoyed 
programming for the first time, creating my own tools and analysing data. These tools allowed me to play with files, try
different things and see the results in a really fast pace. It was not easy to learn to program and understand about
computer science. But I felt this was the right area for me, and really found myself in bioinformatics. I see bioinformatics 
as a modern and robust approach to study biology. I am very happy with how my career turned out so far, and I am eternally 
greatful to all of the many wonderful people who helped me navigate through it.
