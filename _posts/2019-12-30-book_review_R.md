My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3035905480">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
This is a great book for anyone interested in R. It is very complete, has a strong introductory part and also more advanced content. It is still modern for 2019, with trendy issues, like machine learning and visualization. <br /><br />I have worked with this book having a strong background in programming, but I don't think this is a requirement. I would recommend it for anyone who wants to learn R as a first or second language. <br /><br />If you work hard using this book, you could achieve a somewhat fluent level in R in a reasonably short time. Read the book (skipping the in-depth parts), write and run the scripts in your computer, and you will learn R.
