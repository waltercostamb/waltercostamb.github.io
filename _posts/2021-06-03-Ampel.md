The University of Leipzig Medical Center is a very large institution, with 6,000 employees, in which
450,000 patients are cared for annually. Around 15,000 laboratory parameters are measured every single 
day in its Institute for Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Chemistry and Molecular Diagnostic.  

The <a href="https://www.ampel.care/en/">AMPEL project</a> (Analysis and Reporting System for the Improvement 
of Patient Safety through Real-Time Integration of Laboratory Findings) is a 
[research project](https://vismedica.com/blog/2020/09/15/projekt-ampel-in-fachmedium-publiziert/) that aims 
at improving patient safety by monitoring laboratory parameters automatically. I am very happy to be part
of the AMPEL team and to contribute by analysing laboratory data with techniques from statistics and data 
science. AMPEL is composed of specialists from different fields, including bioinformatics and computational biology, 
biomathematics and medicine.

We just published the computational structure and framework of this Clinical Decision Support System in the scientific
journal JMIR Medical Informatics. You can find the publication in this [link](https://medinform.jmir.org/2021/6/e20407/).
