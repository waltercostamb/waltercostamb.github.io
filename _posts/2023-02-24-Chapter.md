The book "RNA Structure Prediction" has been recently published in both online and physical formats. I wrote a chapter entitled "Evolutionary Conservation 
of RNA Secondary Structure", which you can access in the following [link](https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-0716-2768-6_8). This chapter 
was written in the form of a protocol to analyse the evolution of ncRNA structures.
