I just finished a wonderful book and decided to post a review on this blog, even though it is not directly related to my work.
I still think it is relevant to post it here, since "Women who run with the wolves" is a very important book about the
psychology of women. Being a woman on a STEM field is challenging <a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> 
<a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a> <a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a> and I find it very useful to talk about that and discuss ways to overcome challenges. To survive the grad studies and 
strive in STEM, it is paramount to connect with successful people who can support and mentor you, especially in the case of 
women, people of colour or anyone who belongs to a minority group. 

It is also incredibly important to devote time to yourself, cultivate hobbies that make you happy and take very good care 
of your mental health. "Women who run with the wolves" is a book that speaks to all women and can be a valuable asset to 
improve our knowledge about ourselves. Female (and male) scientists rely almost exclusively on their minds, but our lives would be 
very limited if we did not listen to our bodies and intuitions as well. This book talks about reconnecting with our wild women,
our feelings and intuition, which is essentially taking care of our mental health!

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2151197158">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Each chapter of <b>Women who run with the wolves</b> enlightens one aspect of women's lives by exploring one or more fairy tale. Love, life, death, creative work, relationships with others and with oneself are explored with a sensitivity that I have never seen before. Clarissa Pinkola Estés is a <i>cuentista</i>, a story-teller. Not only has she collected and studied fairy-tales for over twenty years, she has also dissected their archetypes, issues that are common for women and that do not change among generations. The first edition was released in 1992, but this book could not be any more modern. The world changes, the situation of women changes, but our feelings of overwhelm, confusion, depression and detachment remain the same. The solutions for being whole again after a meaningful or traumatic event remain the same. We can only heal, grow and act true to ourselves if we reconnect with our true nature.<br /><br />Body and mind are not independent entities, these should act together. We should listen not only<br />to our minds, but also to our bodies, our intuition, to the voice of the wild woman, the one who is born within every woman. We are not living only to exist, please others or stagnate. We are here to create, to think for ourselves, live our cyclic natures of life-death-life. To give birth to our art, be it as it may, requires a lot of courage, determination, and work. Life is tough, but things can get easier if you know what to expect. Estés showed in this book that although life can be daunting, it needs not to be hopeless. We can face it as an adventure, a fairy-tale, with its wonders and horrors. <b>Women who run with the wolves</b> is a book that changed my life. It gave me the strength I needed to go on, and to know that I am enough, I have everything I need to live a full, happy and fulfilled life.<br /><br />Some parts of the book are dedicated to forgiveness, loving our bodies and other very important issues. The strongest focus though is on how to reconnect ourselves with <i>la selva subterránea</i>, the wild nature, and how to clear our souls to allow the creativity to flow freely. To do that we should dive deep within our souls, searching for the instinct, the old, the wild. The woman who completed the full descent finally reunites with her four forces: the <i>animus</i>, who acts, does, translates between the deep and the objective worlds; the Self, who was created by the woman after the descent; the wild mother, who intuits; and the initiated, the self that can navigate both the deep and objective worlds.
