	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I am an applied Bioinformatician and have worked in different biological and medical areas. In my Master studies, I
		researched the genetic variability of anti-DNA antibodies and found that part of the antibody heavy chain already 
		confer DNA recognition. This opens new doors for research in systemic lupus erythematosus, since these patients 
		have anti-DNA antibodies.
		
		Afterwards, from 2013 to 2018 I studied evolution of ncRNA structures during my PhD studies. Among other things,
		I developed the first tool in the scientific community that can detect positive selection in ncRNA structures.
		My tool, the SSS-test, allowed me to further characterize a few candidates that are relevant for neurodegenerative 
		diseases. I have found that they have local strucures that are fast-evolving in the human species.</p>
		
	<p>Apart from these results, I have worked in Brazil, Germany and Mexico with multi-cultural teams. I specialized in 
		communicating proficiently with researchers from different fields and backgrounds, which is quite challenging. 
		Problem-solving communication creates an efficient environment to problem solving.</p> 
		
	<p>During my career, I have developed my own organizational framework, based on a personal lab book, which I write in Latex. 
		Along with GIT, a version control tool, for my lab book and my codes, I found a very efficient and productive way to 
		work. Using this framework, I managed to write my PhD dissertation in only 170 hours, which is a very short time.
		I invite you to take a look at the visual scheme below and follow my 
		<a href="https://github.com/waltercostamb/Lab-Book">tutorial</a>
		to start your own Lab Book in Latex.</p>
