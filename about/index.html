	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I studied biological sciences in Brazil at the University of Brasília from 2006 to 2009. Afterwards I did my Masters
		at the molecular biology department also at the University of Brasília from 2010 to 2012. From 2013 to 2018 
		I completed my PhD studies in Germany at the faculty of mathematics and computer science of the University of 
		Leipzig. My research focus at the PhD was evolution of non-coding RNA structures. This was a theoretical work, in
		which I developed new tools and analysed primate data. I also worked on projects in immunology, metagenomics and 
		industrial improvement of microorganisms.</p>
	
	<p>I have worked in Brazil as well as Germany with multi-cultural teams. I specialized in communicating proficiently with
		researchers from different fields, including biology, biochemistry, computer science and statistics. I can 
		translate the ideas of a biological problem into structured sub-problems that can be tackled with computational 
		techniques. In addition, I can also communicate the technical results to researchers from biology. This creates 
		an efficient environment to problem solving.</p> 
		
	<p>During my career as a bioinformatician, I have developed my own organizational framework. I write down every task I do 
		every day in my personal lab book, which I write in Latex. This makes it easier and faster to transfer blocks of 
		text to other documents, such as reports or presentations. In addition to that, I save all new versions of my 
		"lab-book.tex" document in GIT, along with my codes, so that I can easily transfer my work to different computers. 
		I also take time to plan my week and organize it into Trello cards or bullet points onto a paper notebook. My 
		framework optimizes my time and boosts my productivity. I invite you to take a look at the visual scheme below and 
		try my Latex tutorial to start your own Lab Book in Latex.</p>
