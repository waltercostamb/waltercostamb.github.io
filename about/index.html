	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I started in the field of Bioinformatics in 2008 in my undergraduation studies, when I learned perl programming, Latex and Unix systems. 
		Since then, I tackled problems in different biological systems. I am currently analysing data of laboratory medicine,
		focusing on detecting early signs of anemia.</p>
		
	<p>In my PhD studies, I developed different methods and algorithms 
		to study evolution of non-coding RNAs. Most prominently, I developed the
		<a href="https://github.com/waltercostamb/SSS-test">SSS-test</a>, 
		the first test in the scientific community that can detect positive selection in ncRNA structures. 
		With the SSS-test, it is possible to 
		<a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-2711-y">detect fast-evolving local strucures in ncRNAs.</a></p>
		
	<p>In my Master studies, I used Bayesian statistics to find that 
		<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0072625">heavy chains confer DNA recognition
		properties to antibodies</a>, opening new doors for research in systemic lupus erythematosus, a medical condition that
		produces anti-DNA antibodies.</p>    
		
	<p>In addition to scientific findings, I specialized in communicating proficiently with researchers from different 
		fields, backgrounds and cultures. I worked with collaborators from Germany, Brazil, Mexico, Canada 
		and India.</p> 
		
	<p>In order to be productive and objective in my work, I have developed my strategy for documentation, backup and planning. This is based on a 
		personal lab book, which I write in Latex. I also use Git daily, a version control tool, for updating my lab book 
		and my codes. As an example of how efficient my framework is, I managed to write my PhD dissertation in only 170 hours, 
		which is an extremely short time for such a task. I invite you to take a look at the visual scheme below and follow my tutorial to
