	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I have worked in different biological and medical areas throughout my career. In my Master studies, I
		found that 
		<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0072625">antibody heavy chains already confer DNA recognition</a>. 
		This opens new doors for research in systemic lupus erythematosus, since these patients have anti-DNA antibodies.</p>    
		
	<p>Afterwards, in my PhD studies, I helped to further characterize a few biomarkers that are relevant for neurodegenerative 
		diseases. This was possible with my software 
		<a href="https://github.com/waltercostamb/SSS-test">SSS-test</a>, 
		the first one in the scientific community that can detect positive selection in ncRNA structures. 
		<a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-2711-y">With the SSS-test, it was 
		possible to detect fast-evolving local strucures in those biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases</a>, 
		which helps us to better understand them.</p>
		
	<p>In addition to these scientific findings, I specialized in communicating proficiently with researchers from different 
		fields and backgrounds. Effective communication creates an ideal environment to problem solving.</p> 
		
	<p>In order to be productive and objective in my work, I have developed my strategy for documentation, backup and planning. This is based on a 
		personal lab book, which I write in Latex. I also use Git daily, a version control tool, for updating my lab book 
		and my codes. As an example of how efficient my framework is, I managed to write my PhD dissertation in only 170 hours, 
		which is a very short time for such a task. I invite you to take a look at the visual scheme below and follow my tutorial to
		<a href="https://github.com/waltercostamb/Lab-Book">start your own Lab Book in Latex</a>.</p>
