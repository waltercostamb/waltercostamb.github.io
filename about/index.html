	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I studied biological sciences in Brazil at the University of Brasília from 2006 to 2009. Afterwards I did my Masters
		at the molecular biology department also at the University of Brasília from 2010 to 2012. From 2013 to 2018 I
		completed my PhD studies in Germany at the faculty of mathematics and computer science of the University of 
		Leipzig. In my Masters I studied the specificity of antibodies in the recognition of DNA using bioinformatics
		techniques. My PhD project was in human brain evolution. We wanted to understand the role of long ncRNAs in
		brain, compared to other closely related species. This was a completely theoretical work in ncRNA bioinformatics.
		I developed new methods and algorithms to study ncRNA evolution based on their structures.

		After my PhD I have worked in Brazil on two other fields of biology, namely metagenomics, at the Federal University of 
		Bahia, and industrial improvement of microorganism at (EMBRAPA Agroenergy). My interests are in solving biological 
		problems with bioinformatics techniques. That requires lots of planing, data analysis, programming and results discussion.
	
		I have worked in Brazil as well as Germany with multi-cultural teams. I specialized in communicating proficiently with
		other researchers in different fields of bioinformatics, including biology and computer science. I can translate the
		general ideas of a biological problem into structured sub-problems that can be tackled with computer techniques. In
		addition, I can also communicate the technical results to researchers from biology. This creates a much better environment
		to problem solving. 
	
		Currently, I have been learning more about statistics and machine learning and also devoting some time to this
		website, especially the popular science blog section, which you can find <a href="/blog">here</a></p>
