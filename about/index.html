	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I have worked in different biological and medical areas throughout my career. In my Master studies, I
		found that antibody heavy chains already confer DNA recognition. This opens new doors for research in systemic 
		lupus erythematosus, since these patients have anti-DNA antibodies.</p>    
		
	<p>Afterwards, in my PhD studies, I further characterized a few biomarkers that are relevant for neurodegenerative 
		diseases. This was possible with my software 'SSS-test', the first one in the scientific community that can detect 
		positive selection in ncRNA structures. I detected fast-evolving local strucures in those biomarkers of 
		neurodegenerative disease, which helps us to better understand them.</p>
		
	<p>In addition to these scientific findings, I specialized in communicating proficiently with researchers from different 
		fields and backgrounds. Effective communication creates an ideal environment to problem solving.</p> 
		
	<p>In order to be productive and objective in my work, I have developed my own organizational framework. This is based on a 
		personal lab book, which I write in Latex. I also use GIT daily, a version control tool, for updating my lab book 
		and my codes. As an example of how efficient my framework is, I managed to write my PhD dissertation in only 170 hours, 
		which is a very short time for such a task. I invite you to take a look at the visual scheme below and follow my 
		<a href="https://github.com/waltercostamb/Lab-Book">tutorial</a>
		to start your own Lab Book in Latex.</p>
