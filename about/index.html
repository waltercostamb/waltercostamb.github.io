	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I started in the field of Bioinformatics in 2008 and have since tackled problems in different biological systems. 
		In my last position, I  
		<a href="https://waltercostamb.github.io/blog/2021/06/03/Ampel">analysed data of laboratory medicine</a>.</p>
		
	<p>In my PhD studies, I developed different methods and algorithms 
		to study evolution of non-coding RNAs. Most prominently, I developed the
		<a href="https://github.com/waltercostamb/SSS-test">SSS-test</a>, 
		the first test in the scientific community that can detect positive selection in ncRNA structures. 
		With the SSS-test, it is possible to detect 
		<a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-2711-y">fast-evolving strucures</a> 
		in any biological system.</p>
		
	<p>In my Master studies, using Bayesian statistics, I found that heavy chains of antibodies confer
		<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0072625">DNA recognition
		properties</a>, opening new doors for research in systemic lupus erythematosus, a medical condition that
		is characterized by the presence of anti-DNA antibodies.</p>    
		
	<p>In addition, I specialized in communicating proficiently with researchers from different 
		fields, backgrounds and cultures. I have worked with collaborators from Germany, Brazil, Mexico, Canada 
		and India. I am interested in languages, being fluent in brazilian Portuguese and English and advanced speaker 
		of German and Spanish. </p> 
		
	<p>I also developed my own organization strategy, which is centered on a computational lab book, which I write in LaTex. 
		I also use Git daily, a version control tool, for updating my lab book and codes. With that, 
		I managed to write my PhD dissertation in only 170 hours. I invite you to take a look at 
		the visual scheme below and follow my tutorial to start your own
